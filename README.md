### Hello, I'm Vibhuti Bansal ! 
I'm a **Data Science Enthusiast** and always love to learn more about **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**.
 #### Following are links to some of my recent work:
 
- **[4-class lung disease detection including COVID](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/CWBCCE-COVID19)** : This paper includes preprocessing technique for contrast enhancement along with correlation based metric undersampling for CXR images.The neural network takes into account a new custom loss function to reduce class imbalance.

- **[Canny Edge Detection](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/CannyEdge)** : Implementation of Canny Edge Detection Algorithm from scratch.
- 
- **[Indian Classical Dance forms](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/Indian-Dance-Classification-)**, Paper DOI : https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/14/6253. Indian classical dance (ICD) classification is an interesting subject because of its complex body posture. It provides a stage to experiment with various computer vision and deep learning concepts. The input to the proposed network is initially pre-processed using image thresholding and sampling. Next, a truncated DCNN based on ResNet50 is applied to the pre-processed samples. The proposed model gives an accuracy score of 0.911
- **[Covid-19](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/COVID19)** prioritizes people on the basis of their symptoms and locality.  This tool helps us to identify priorities of need of vaccine in a city compared to others. Data Preprocessing, Feature selection, and unsupervised learning(KMeans) were used in a pipeline as
the model design.

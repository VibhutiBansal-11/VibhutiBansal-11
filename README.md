### Hello <img src="https://github.com/thomasbnt/thomasbnt/blob/me/hi.gif" width="25px">, I'm Vibhuti Bansal ! 
I'm a **Data Science Enthusiast** and always love to learn more about **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**.
 #### Following are links to some of my recent work:
- **[Canny Edge Detection](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/CannyEdge)**. This is implementation of Canny Edge Detection Algo from scratch.
- I also created the project to classify different types of **[Indian Classical Dance forms](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/Indian-Dance-Classification-)**, using ResNet.
- **[Covid-19](https://github.com/VibhutiBansal-11/COVID19)** prioritizes people on the basis of their symptoms and locality.
